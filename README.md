<h1>Get the dataset!</h1>
This repo assumes you have the dataset in the directory. We won't be tracking it here since it is huge, but if you want to run this you can download it <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/python-pog-spectogram-music-classification?resource=download">here.</a>

In order to change the data and the way things are set up, run
<strong>
bash setup_data.sh
</strong>
and that will enumerate through all the necessary scripts. In order for that to work, you will need to change the line that gives you an error to some way of running a new version of python. Alternatively, you can execute those commands in that order as well. This just makes it easier to adjust the dimensionality of the images.
